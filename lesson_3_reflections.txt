When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I want to keep a remote repo clean and simple, not all the changes I might to
    pull to a remote repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a GitHub feature: it clones someone's else Github remote repo to
    your GitHub repo. Clones is a git feature, it allows you to copy repositories
    inside local and remote machines and between them. Branches are commit trees,
    which represents state history of a repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    We can exaninate all potintial conflicts which could occur if we'd use pull,
    this way we have time to think how to remove them and merge two branches
    even being offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I'd use simple messages to let other people know what changes I made.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
